# home

My personal dotfiles and scripts I put in my home directory

## usage

* Check out this repo under your `$HOME` directory
* `cd` into the checked out repo
* For each program you want the dotfiles for, run the command `stow ${PROGRAM_NAME}`

i.e. To get dotfiles for `bash`, run `stow bash`

For `bash` you also will want to add a line to your own `.bashrc` or `.bash_profile` to source `$HOME/.bashrc_custom`
